Some Known Patterns

- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide & Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithims
- Backtracking

Frequency Counter

- this pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values. Often can avoid using nested loops with arrays and strings.

Multiple Points

- creating pointers of values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle based on a certain condition. Efficient for solving problems with mininal space complexity as well.

Sliding Window

- this pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases of closes( and a new window is created). Useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.

Divide & Conquer

- this pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. Can decrease time complexity tremendously
