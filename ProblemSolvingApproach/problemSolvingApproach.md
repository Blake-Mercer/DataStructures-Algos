What is an Algorithim

- a process or set of step to accomplish a certain task
  How to you improve
- devise a plan for solving problems
- master common problem solving patterns

Problem Solving Strategies

- understand the problem
- explore concrete examples
- break it down
- solve/simplify
- look back and refactor

Understand The Problem

1. can you restate the problem in your own words?
2. what are the input that go into the problem?
3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do you have enough info?
5. how should I label the important pieces of data?

Concrete Examples

- start with simple examples
- progress to more complex examples
- explore examples with empty inputs
- explore examples with invalid inputs

Break It Down

- explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

Solve or Simplify

- solve the problem, if you can't, solve a simplier problem
- - find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- - temporarily ignore that difficulty
- - incorporate that difficulty back in

Look Back and Refactor

- can you check the result
- can you derive the result differently
- can you understand it at a glance
- can you use the result of method from some other problem
- can you improve the performance of your solution
- how have other people solved this problem
