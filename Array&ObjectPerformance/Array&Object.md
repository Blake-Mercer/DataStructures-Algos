When to use Objects?

When you dont need order.
When you need fast access/insertion and removal.

insertion - O(1)
removal - O(1)
access - O(1)
searching - O(n)

When to use Arrays?

When you need order.
When you need fast access/insertion and removal(sort of..)

insertion - IT DEPENDS
removal - IT DEPENDS
searching - O(n)
access - O(1)

push and pop are always faster than shift and unshift.
